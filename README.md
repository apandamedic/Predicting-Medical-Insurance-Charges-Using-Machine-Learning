# Predicting-Medical-Insurance-Charges-Using-Machine-Learning
# Medical Cost Prediction using Regression Models

This project demonstrates the prediction of medical insurance charges using a mock dataset. We use data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to understand and predict the charges.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize patterns and relationships in the data.
2. Preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning.
3. Train and evaluate two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest.
4. Compare the models based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score.
